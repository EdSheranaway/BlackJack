A little intro into Blackjack for begginers:
Goal of the game is for the player's hand to get as close to 21 without going over it, all the while having more points than the dealer.
Each numbered card is worth the same amount of points as its value (e.g. Four of Hearts is equal to 4 points, suits don't matter!
Each face card is worth 10 points, aces are a special case in which they're worth either 11 or 1 points, depending on what benefits the player more!
At the start of each round, the player makes their bet and then may choose to hit or stand:
Hit means the dealer adds another card to the players hand, increasing in value, but be careful not to go over 21!
Stand means to stop adding cards and go through with the bet.

Enjoy!
